The files eggtrayicon.h and eggtrayicon.cpp in this directory come
from the libegg library (a library of GTK+ and Gnome add-ons,
containing features that often later get incorporated in GTK+ or
Gnome), and are released by the copyright owners under the GNU Lesser
General Public License, version 2.  See eggtrayicon.h and
eggtrayicon.cpp files for particulars.

The particular versions of those files in this directory are taken
from the Gaim instant messaging client (they will compile with
GTK+-2.0 - the versions in libegg CVS require a minimum of GTK+-2.2).
