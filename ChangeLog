--------------

	Use GtkToolItem interface where compiled against GTK+ >= 2.4
	(fax_list.cpp, file_list.cpp, socket_list.cpp,

	Correct failure to clear the list of permitted client addresses
	for the socket interface after changing settings from the settings

	the user (fax_list.h, fax_list.cpp, main.cpp, mainwindow.cpp,
	print_manager.h, print_manager.cpp, utils/intrusive_ptr.h,
	src/Makefile.am and src/Makefile.in).

	Revise method for passing of arguments to threads

	Update the copyright dates in the efax-gtk man file (efax-gtk.1).

Version 3.0.11 (19th August 2006)
--------------

	Correct file descriptor leak when viewing a fax (fax_list.h and
	fax_list.cpp).

	Implement printing of faxes in fax lists via the GTK+ print system
	where compiled against GTK+2.10 or higher (acinclude.m4,
	aclocal.m4, configure.ac, configure, efax-gtkrc, po/POTFILES.in,
	src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, dialogs.h, fax_list.h,
	fax_list.cpp, main.cpp, print_manager.h, print_manager.cpp,
	prog_defs.h, settings.h, settings.cpp, settings_help.h,
	settings_help.cpp, utils/window.cpp).

	Improve handling of user locales with streams (acinclude.m2,

	mainwindow.cpp, settings.cpp and socket_server.cpp).

	Use AC_COMPILE_IFELSE/AC_LANG_PROGRAM autoconf macros instead of
	the AC_TRY_COMPILE macro when configuring the program
	(acinclude.m4 and aclocal.m4).

	Correct derivation of fdistream class for wide characters (not

	Improve time reporting to main window and to logfile
	(mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cpp and efax/efaxmsg.c).
	
	Have GobjHandle<> sink objects with floating references, and with

	g_object_ref()/gtk_object_sink() (utils/gobj_handle.h,
	utils/widget.h, utils/widget.cpp, dialogs.cpp and mainwindow.cpp).

	Have consistent keys shortcuts for the closing of dialogs
	(addressbook.cpp, dialogs.h, dialogs.cpp, fax_list.cpp and
	helpfile.cpp).

	Use in_addr_t type explicitly where relevant (socket_server.cpp,
	prog_defs.h, configure.ac, acinclude.m4 and aclocal.m4).

	Move initialisation of std::string prog_fifo_name (previously
	std::string fifo_name) from MainWindow::pipe_thread() to
	MainWindow::start_pipe_thread() to prevent read access of
	ProgConfig::working_dir by more than one thread (mainwindow.h and

	use CUPS lpadmin to set up a virtual printer for efax-gtk as an
	alternative to using the CUPS web interface and updating the man
	file (settings_help.cpp, README and efax-gtk.1).

Version 3.0.9 (11th March 2006)
-------------
	
	Swedish translation added (Daniel Nylander).

	Catalan translation added (Jordi Sayol Salomo).

	Use gtk_widget_queue_draw() to update the drawing area which
	indicates whether a fax is in the "faxes to send" queue via an
	expose event rather than doing it directly (mainwindow.cpp).

	Cater for serial port devices in sub-directories of /dev
	(main.cpp).

	Have Notifier objects detect whether the signalling thread is the
	same one as the thread in which the slot will execute and if so
	by-pass the Notifier pipe, and implement Notifier objects without
	using a map and object IDs.  (main.cpp, socket_server.cpp,
	utils/notifier.h and utils/notifier.cpp).

	Correctly handle case of constructor of SharedPtr and SharedHandle
	objects throwing (utils/shared_ptr.h and utils/shared_handle.h)

	Allow the program to compile without X (configure.ac,
	acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, main.cpp, tray_icon.h, tray_icon.cpp and

	Correct comments about the use of PipeFifo::connect_to_stdout()
	and PipeFifo::connect_to_stderr() (utils/pipes.h).

	Improve text for translation about modem classes (efax.c).

	Include <ostream> and <istream> headers file where relevant
	(configure.ac, include.m4, aclocal.m4, addressbook.cpp,
	efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.cpp, fax_list_manager.cpp, main.cpp,
	mainwindow.cpp, socket_list.cpp, socket_notify.cpp,
	socket_server.cpp and tray_icon.cpp).

	Revise locking of prog_config objects (dialogs.cpp,
	efax_controller.cpp and fax_list.cpp).

Version 3.0.8 (14th January 2006)
-------------

	Update Greek translation (Hellenic Linux Users Group).

	Add German translation (po/de.po and mainwindow.cpp) (Steffen
	Wagner).

	Destroy thread attribute object correctly (utils/thread.h and
	utils/thread.cpp).

	Use GtkSpinButton objects in the settings dialog where relevant
	(settings.h, settings.cpp and settings_help.cpp).

	Improve documentation/commenting of write_error() function
	(mainwindow.cpp).

	Update gettext tools to latest version (gettext-0.14.5)
	(po/Makevars and po/Rules-quot).

	Move typedef of InstanceMap into the Notifier class
	(utils/notifier.h and utils/notifier.cpp).

	Provide specific CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS specification in rpm spec
	file (efax-gtk.spec.in and efax-gtk.spec).

Version 3.0.7 (23rd November 2005)
-------------

	NOTE: Fax descriptions in the fax lists are now stored in UTF-8
	rather than the locale codeset.  This means that any fax
	descriptions previously stored in a codeset other than ASCII or
	UTF-8 by efax-gtk will not be shown in version 3.0.7.  Sorry about
	that, but the former method of storing them in the locale codeset
	was bound to lead to trouble, because in due course Unix-like
	systems will adopt UTF-8 as their standard codeset and on changing
	codesets, previously entered file description were bound to be
	broken anyway.  This gets it over with.  To show these fax
	descriptions again, the contents of all the files with the name
	Description in the $HOME/[WORK_SUBDIR]/faxin/[faxnumber] and
	$HOME/[WORK_SUBDIR]/faxsent/[faxnumber] directories will need to
	be changed from the locale codeset to UTF-8.  gedit can do this
	manually, although it will be a bit tedious.

	Corrections to man pages (Lior Kaplan) (efax-gtk.1, efax.1 and
	efix.1).

	Enable file names to be used in locale codesets other than ASCII
	or UTF-8 (efax_controller.cpp, fax_list_manager.cpp,
	mainwindow.cpp, efax/efax.c, efax/efaxio.c and efax/efaxlib.c).

	Make keyboard navigation of FileReadSelectDialog class work
	correctly where implemented with a GtkFileDhooserDialog object
	(dialogs.cpp).

	Update the README file to explain the setting of the
	G_FILENAME_ENCODING environmental variable for file systems using
	other than the ASCII or UTF-8 codesets (README).

	Add some stray missing std namespace scope qualifiers so that the
	program compiles without a using-directive for std namespace
	(file_list.cpp, main.cpp, socket_list.h, socket_list.cpp and
	socket_server.cpp).

	Make the methods of the Thread::CancelBlock class explicitly
	static (utils/thread.h).

	Update Russian translation (Pavel Vainerman) (po/ru.po and
	mainwindow.cpp).

Version 3.0.6 (16th October 2005)
-------------

	Add simplified Chinese translation (Kite Lau).

	Provide internationalisation support for the efax program to which
	efax-gtk is a front end (configure.ac, efax_controller.h,
	efax_controller.cpp, main.cpp, mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cpp,
	efax/Makefile.am, efax/efax.c, efax/efaxio.c, efax/efaxlib.h,
	efax/efaxlib.c, efax/efaxmsg.h, efax/efaxmsg.c, utils/utf8_utils.h
	and utils/utf8_utils.cpp; man file efax/efax.1).

	Make the fax top header line of a sent fax charset independent,
	and remove some incorrect codeset conversions
	(efax_controller.cpp, main.cpp, settings.h, settings.cpp and
	settings_help.cpp).

	Deal with two minor timing/race issues (efax_controller.h and
	efax_controller.cpp).

	Make Notifier::make_id() a static method, since it only uses local
	or static objects (notifier.h).

	Instead of omitting the call to setlocale() in efax/efix.c, after
	setting the locales to match their environment, reset LC_NUMERIC
	to the "C" locale (efax/efix.c).

	Update Hungarian translation (Gergely Szakats).

Version 3.0.5 (11th September 2005)
-------------

	Provide a further explicit cast to void* in sentinel for elipsis
	arguments, for 64-bit systems (mainwindow.cpp).

	Provide for the automatic updating of the fax lists when a fax is
	received or sent (efax_controller.h, efax_controller.cpp,
	fax_list.h, fax_list.cpp, fax_list_manager.h,
	fax_list_manager.cpp, helpfile.cpp, mainwindow.h and
	mainwindow.cpp).

	Provide for the received fax list to show the number of new faxes
	received since the program was last started (efax_controller.h,
	efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.h, fax_list.cpp, helpfile.cpp,
	mainwindow.cpp, tray_icon.h and tray_icon.cpp)

	Make minor changes to handling of colours of certain labels
	(mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp).

	Make the program close properly if the "Quit" item is chosen from
	the system tray menu and a blocking modal dialog is showing
	(utils/window.cpp).

	Remove unnecessary use of GtkAlignment objects to adjust labels
	(GtkLabel derives from GtkMisc) (addressbook.cpp and
	settings.cpp).

	Make Notifier::read_pipe_slot() a static method (utils/notifier.h,
	utils/notifier.cpp and sigc_compatibility.h).

	Call the slot connected to an iowatch via a sigc::signal object
	rather than directly, so sigc::trackable is effective
	(utils/iowatch.h and utils/iowatch.cpp).

	Change text when prompting to delete or print faxes now that fax
	id numbers are not shown in fax lists (fax_list.cpp).

	Remove exception specifications in shared pointer/handle classes
	(utils/gobj_handle.h, utils/shared_handle.h and
	utils/shared_ptr.h).

	Include a guard when creating a FaxListDialog object so we cannot
	call it up twice through the call to gtk_main_iteration() in
	FaxListManager::populate_fax_list() (fax_list_manager.h,
	fax_list_manager.cpp and mainwindow.cpp).

	Provide an exception to the LGPL in its application to files
	containing templates to allow instantiation of templates by
	program source code without imposing restrictions on the use of
	the resulting object code (utils/fdstream.h, utils/fdstream.tcc,
	utils/gobj_handle.h, utils/shared_handle.h and
	utils/shared_ptr.h).

	Change the "Copyright" field to a "License" field in RPM spec file
	(efax-gtk.spec.in and efax-gtk.spec).

	Update Russian translation (Pavel Vainerman).

Version 3.0.4 (13th August 2005)
-------------

	Add a date column to the fax lists, which derives the time of the
	fax from the fax ID (the directory in which faxes are stored)
	(Pavel Vainerman and Chris Vine). (fax_list_manager.h,
	fax_list_manager.cpp and helpfile.cpp; and README)
	
	Provide for the fax ID (the directory in which faxes are stored)
	for received faxes to be derived from the time that the fax is
	received rather than the time that efax-gtk is put into receive
	mode.  This enables the fax lists to display the correct time of a
	received fax. (Chris Vine) (efax_controller.h,
	efax_controller.cpp, fax_list_manager.h, fax_list_manager.cpp,
	main.cpp, mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cpp and prog_defs.h)

	Now that stored fax directories (fax name IDs) are not displayed
	in the fax lists, provide the part of the ID representing a year
	in 4 (or more) digit rather than 2 digit format (someone in 2099
	might be pleased!). (Chris Vine) (efax_controller.cpp,
	fax_list_manager.cpp and main.cpp)

	Put a UTF-8 validation function in namespace Utf8 (Chris Vine)
	(fax_list_manager.h, utils/utf8_utils.h and utils/utf8_utils.cpp).

	Move gobj_handle.h, icon_info_handle.h, io_watch.h, io_watch.cpp,
	mutex.h, notifier.h, notifier.cpp, pipes.h, pipes.cpp,
	selected_rows_handle.h, selected_rows_handle.cpp, sem_sync.h,
	shared_handle.h, shared_ptr.h, thread.h, thread.cpp,
	tree_path_handle.h, tree_row_reference_handle.h, utf8_utils.h,
	utf8_utils.cpp, widget.h, widget.cpp, window.h and window.cpp to
	src/utils sub-directory and change licence from GPL to LGPL.  Move
	fdstream.h and fdstream.tcc from src/fdstream sub-directory to
	src/utils sub-directory.

	Where relevant, handle PipeFifo and Notifier errors by exceptions
	- consequential on putting the source for these in the utils
	sub-directory (Chris Vine) (fax_list.cpp, main.cpp, prog_defs.h,
	utils/notifier.h, utils/notifier.cpp, utils/pipes.h and
	utils/pipes.cpp).

	Change clean-up arrangements on start-up (Chris Vine)
	(efax_controller.h, efax_controller.cpp and main.cpp).

	Correct false calls to _exit() in FaxListDialog::view_fax_thread()
	(Chris Vine) (fax_list.cpp).

	Make the PipeFifo and SemSync classes explicitly non-copiable
	(Chris Vine) (utils/pipes.h and utils/sem_sync.h).

	Provide further explicit casts to void* in sentinels for elipsis
	arguments for 64-bit systems (Chris Vine) (addressbook.cpp,
	fax_list_manager.cpp, file_list.cpp, mainwindow.cpp and
	socket_list.cpp).

	Update Hebrew translation (Assaf Gillat).

Version 3.0.3 (16th July 2005)
-------------

	Provide a settings option to omit the destination fax number from
	the fax page top header line (efax_controller.cpp, main.cpp,
	prog_defs.h, settings.h, settings.cpp, settings_help.h and
	settings_help.cpp).

	Use a mutex to ensure that writes to the Notifier pipe are atomic
	between threads (IEEE Std 1003.1, 2001 Edition guarantees that
	writes by different processes to a pipe of less than PIPE_BUF in
	size are atomic, but not in relation to writes by threads within
	any one process). (notifier.h and notifier.cpp).

	Some fixes for 64 bit systems:
	  Update gettext configuration (including removing relevant macros
	  from acinclude.m4) (acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure and
	  po/Makefile.in.in).

	  Provide an explicit cast to void* in a sentinel for elipsis
	  arguments (mainwindow.cpp).

	Fixes for (harmless) warnings issued by gcc-4.0, about pointer
	targets differing in signedness (efax.c, efaxio.c and efaxlib.c).

Version 3.0.2 (5th June 2005)
-------------

	Close the socket server by using pthread_cancel() with a suitable
	choice of cancellation point, to guarantee that the socket is
	closed correctly under all conditions; this also requires that
	pthreads be used explicitly (efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.cpp,
	main.cpp, mainwindow.cpp, mutex.h, socket_server.h,
	socket_server.cpp, thread.h and thread.cpp; acinclude.m4,
	aclocal.m4 and configure.ac).

	Provide for efax-gtk to kill any fax viewing sessions which are
	open when efax-gtk is closed (main.cpp).

	Simplify and improve the implementation of the fax lists
	(fax_list_manager.h, fax_list_manager.cpp, selected_rows_handle.h,
	selected_rows_handle.cpp and tree_row_reference.h).

	Add an option to the mail_fax script to enable the received fax to
	be e-mailed in PDF (Portable Document Format) as well as PS
	(PostScript) formats. (mail_fax).
	
	Use a custom iowatch object instead of a GIOChannel object when
	all we want to do is poll a file descriptor in the main program
	event loop. (efax_controller.h, efax_controller.cpp, mainwindow.h,
	mainwindow.cpp, notifier.h and notifier.cpp and add new files
	io_watch.h and io_watch.cpp).

	Close timer in MessageText destructor (mainwindow.h and
	mainwindow.cpp).

Version 3.0.1 (12th May 2005)
-------------
	
	Add Hungarian translation (Gergely Szakats) (po/LINGUAS, po/hu.po
	and mainwindow.cpp).

	Update the Bulgarian Translation (Zdravko Nikolov).

	Make removal of an address in the addressbook work correctly
	(addressbook.h and addressbook.cpp).

	Make the program clean up correctly if terminated by the X session
	manager (prog_defs.h, main.cpp, efax_controller.h and
	efax_controller.cpp).

	Notify the program when running that the user has started it again
	by means of a fifo, rather than a Unix signal (prog_defs.h,
	main.cpp, mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp).

	Make AddressDialog text length friendly (addressbook.cpp).

	Correct the button reliefs in the fax lists when the fax list is
	first brought up (efax_controller.cpp).

	Correct dependencies in efax-gtk.spec file (efax-gtk.spec and
	efax-gtk.spec.in).

Version 3.0.0 (7th May 2005)
-------------

	Remove dependency on gtkmm (now only GTK+ and libsigc++ are
	required).

	All files in src/ have been revised, with the following new files
	added:

	  gobj_handle.h
	  icon_info_handle.h
	  mutex.h
	  notifier.h/notifier.cpp
	  thread.h/thread.cpp
	  tree_path_handle.h
	  tree_row_reference_handle.h	
	  utf8_utils.h/utf8_utils.cpp
	  widget.h/widget.cpp
	  window.h/window.cpp
	  
	The following files were removed:

	  gtk_icon_info_handle.h
	  tree_model_row_reference.h

	(NOTE: the GTKMM branch in CVS still uses gtkmm: go to that branch
	for any revisions of the version using gtkmm.)

Version 2.2.16 (7th May 2005)
--------------
	
	Albanian translation added (Besnik Bleta).

	Update Russian translation (Pavel Vainerman).

	Update Polish translation (Pawel Suwinski).

	Bring up a prompt when deleting a file in the file list
	(file_list.cpp).

	Use Scoped_handle<> where relevant (mainwindow.cpp and
	socket_server.cpp).

	Increase icon size in panel notification area (tray_icon.cpp).

	Correct order of initialisation of static objects for writing to
	the error pipe (to cater for the unlikely event that the static
	pipe tries to write to itself on error on setting itself up)
	(mainwindow.cpp).

	Some code tidying up (socket_list.h and socket_list.cpp).

	Make corrections to basic_inbuf::underflow() and
	basic_inbuf::xsgetn() methods (doesn't affect efax-gtk but does
	affect any use of the basic_fdistream class - efax-gtk doesn't use
	it). (fdstream.tcc).

Version 2.2.15 (26th February 2005)
--------------

	Fix bug where the Trash folder is dragged in the fax lists
	(fax_list_manager.cpp).

	Greek translation added (the Hellenic Linux Users Group

	efax_controller.cpp).
	
Version 2.2.14 (18th December 2004)
--------------

	Fix bug #1079142 (segmentation fault if a fax for sending is
	received from the print system and the program has been started in
	the system tray and never raised) (mainwindow.cpp).
	
	Check whether the program is already running when it starts up,
	and if it is bring up the existing program instance on the current
	workspace (acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure.ac,

	mainwindow.cpp, socket_server.cpp, fdstream/fdstream.h and
	fdstream/fdstream.tcc).

	Prettify the setting dialog with Gtk::Alignment, and use
	Gtk::Alignment instead of filler widgets (mainwindow.h,
	mainwindow.cpp, settings.h and settings.cpp).

	Some minor code clean-ups (efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.cpp,
	fax_list_manager.cpp, pipes.h, pipes.cpp and socket_server.cpp).

	Update Bulgarian translation (Zdravko Nikolov).

Version 2.2.13 (20th November 2004)
--------------

	Provide a trash folder from which faxes can be moved and then
	physically deleted from the file system (efax-gtk.1, fax_list.h,
	fax_list.cpp, fax_list_manager.h, fax_list_manager_icons.h,
	fax_list_manager.cpp, helpfile.cpp, mainwindow.cpp and README).
	(Once deleted from the trash folder faxes are now removed from the

	Allow multiple faxes to be selected in fax lists (fax_list.cpp,
	fax_list_manager.h, fax_list_manager.cpp, selected_rows_handle.h
	and selected_rows_handle.cpp).

	Make dialog captions consistent (addressbook.cpp, dialogs.cpp,
	fax_list.h, fax_list.cpp, mainwindow.cpp and socket_list.cpp).

	Make Sem_sync::~Sem_sync() take account of the fact that under
	IEEE Std 1003.1 the count value given by sem_getvalue() can be
	less than 0 (a negative number can be used to indicate the number
	of threads waiting on the semaphore) (sem_sync.h).

	Use GTK+ stock icons where available (addressbook.cpp,
	addressbook_icons.h, fax_list.cpp, fax_list_icons.h, file_list.cpp
	file_list_icons.h and mainwindow.cpp).

	Update Russian translation (Pavel Vainerman).

	Update Hebrew translation (Assaf Gillat).
	
Version 2.2.12 (24th October 2004)
--------------

	Make the bottom status bar size itself according to the font size
	choice in Gnome (mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp).

	Make EfaxController::status an enumerated type (efax_controller.h,
	efax_controller.cpp, mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp).

	(mainwindow.cpp, pipes.h, pipes.cpp and prog_defs.h).

	Zero serve_address in Socket_server::socket_thread() before using
	it (socket_server.cpp), and also address in
	efax-gtk-socket-client.cpp (in efax-gtk-faxfilter directory)).

	Some other clean-ups (efax_controller.cpp, main.cpp, settings.cpp
	and shared_ptr.h; efax-gtk-socket-client.cpp (in
	efax-gtk-faxfilter directory)).

	Add commentary about modem class modes in README file.

	Update Hebrew translation (Assaf Gillat).

Version 2.2.11 (25th September 2004)
--------------

	The program can now send a fax when in receive standby mode.  When
	the fax has been sent (or there is an error in sending the fax),
	the program will return to receive standby mode.
	(efax_controller.h, efax_controller.cpp, mainwindow.h and
	mainwindow.cpp).
	
	Allow spaces in file names for faxes to be sent (acceptable file
	name separators are now ',' and ';') (mainwindow.cpp and
	file_list.cpp).
	
	Add Assaf Gillat to the list of translators in the
	translators' pop-up dialog (mainwindow.cpp).

	Put all the child exit handling of efax sessions in
	EfaxController::timer_event() (mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cpp,
	main.cpp, efax_controller.h and efax_controller.cpp).

	Make modal the dialog warning that no fax number has been
	specified when sending a fax (mainwindow.cpp).

	Put the list of translators in MainWindow::translations_slot() in
	a gettext() block (mainwindow.cpp).

	Update Russian transation (Pavel Vainerman).

	Put current URL in rpm spec file (efax-gtk.spec.in and
	efax-gtk.spec).

Version 2.2.10 (5th September 2004)
--------------

	Provide a -r option which starts the program in receive standby
	mode, and a -s option which starts the program hidden in the
	system tray (main.cpp, mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp).
	
	In the fax lists, the folder name and folder icon are placed in a
	single column (fax_list_manager.h and fax_list_manager.cpp).

	Hebrew translation (Assaf Gillat).

	The following patches from http://shino.pos.to/linux/efax/
	have been applied to efax:

	  efax08a-time.patch          (efaxio.c)
	  efax-0.9-nullptr.patch      (efax.c and efaxos.c)
	  efax-0.9-numlines.patch     (efix.c)
	  efax-0.9a-frlen.patch       (efax.c)
	
	And the following patch from Fedora 2:

	  efax-0.9-misc.patch         (efax.c)
	
	Encapsulate valid fax list folder name checking code in new
	FolderNameValidator class (fax_list_manager.h,
	fax_list_manager.cpp and fax_list.cpp).

Version 2.2.9a (9th August 2004)
--------------
	
	Fix incorrect incrementing of STL std:pair<std::string,
	std::string> iterator after erasing object in std::multimap
	container (fax_list_manager.cpp).

	Improve detection of UTF-8 encoding errors (fax_list_manager.cpp).

	Updated Polish translation (Pawel Suwinski).

Version 2.2.9 (25th July 2004)
-------------

	Faxes can be organised in the sent and received fax lists into
	folders, and dragged and dropped between folders.  (fax_list.h,
	fax_list.cpp, fax_list_manager.h, fax_list_manager.cpp and
	tree_model_row_reference.h)

	A working sub-directory for the storage of .efax-gtk_addressbook,
	.efax-gtk_mainwin_save and .efax-gtk_queued_server_files and the
	faxin, faxout, faxsent and efax-gtk-server directories can be
	specified in efax-gtkrc with the WORK_SUBDIR: parameter.
	(addressbook.cpp, dialogs.cpp, efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.cpp,
	fax_list_manager.cpp, main.cpp, mainwindow.cpp, prog_defs.h,
	socket_server.cpp and socket_server.cpp).  (Pavel Vainerman,
	revised by Chris Vine).

	Fix the attempt to call write_error() before the MainWindow object
	has been created.  (main.cpp).

Version 2.2.8a (4th July 2004)
--------------
	
	Revised Bulgarian translation (Zdravko Nikolov).

	Tests for whether phread.h should be included (testing for whether
	HAVE_PTHREAD_SIGPROCMASK is defined) have been corrected
	(efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.cpp and socket_server.cpp).
	(Jean-Baptiste Quenot).

	Fix for overwriting static data on call to gethostbyaddr()
	(socket_server.cpp). (Jean-Baptiste Quenot).

	Fix so that fstream::close() and fstream::clear() are called in
	the correct order. (efax_controller.cpp, fax_list.cpp and
	mainwindow.cpp).

	Some other minor code clean-ups and bug fixes (tray_icon.cpp,
	shared_ptr.h and shared_handle.h).

Version 2.2.8 (18th June 2004)
-------------

	The program will reside in a panel notification area (system
	tray). (mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cpp, tray_icon.h and
	tray_icon.cpp).

	The program pull-down menus use icons in the menu entries for
	which GTK+ stock icons are available.  (mainwindow.cpp and
	tray_icon.cpp).

	GtkIconInfo memory leak fixed in main.cpp (main.cpp and
	gtk_icon_info_handle.h).

	Russian translation (Pavel Vainerman)

	Documentation updates (prog_defs.h, README and efax-gtk.1).

Version 2.2.7a (6th June 2004)
--------------

	When using gtkmm-2.4:

          Gtk::FileChooserDialog is used instead of Gtk::FileSelection as
	  the file selector dialog (dialogs.h, dialogs.cpp and
	  mainwindow.cpp).

          Gtk::IconTheme is used to pick the icon for the program
	  (otherwise the default built-in icon is used) (prog_defs.h and
	  main.cpp).

	The mutex locking of prog_config is cleaned up.

	In dialogs, exec() methods are substituted for run() methods (this
	is because in gtkmm-2.*, Gtk::Dialog has its own non-virtual run()
	method and some dialogs used in the program are derived from
	Gtk::Dialog.  Having a separate exec() method avoids the wrong
	method being called by mistake from a Gtk::Dialog
	pointer/reference (and attempts to call exec() from a Gtk::Dialog
	pointer/reference will fail to compile).

	Lists of files received by the socket server for faxing are passed
	by shared pointer (mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cpp, socket_list.h,
	socket_list.cpp socket_server.h, socket_server.cpp).

	Further clean ups of use of Glib::ustring and std::string
	(dialogs.cpp).

	Some changes to the build system so that AC_CHECK_FILES is used
	instead of AC_CHECK_FILE, and the install will not fail if there
	is no user 'lp' on the system (acinclude.m4, configure.ac,
	prog_defs.h and efax-gtk-socket-client.cpp).
	
Version 2.2.7 (6th May 2004)
-------------

The socket server now runs in its own thread, compliant with the
requirement in IEEE Std 1003.1 that any system calls after fork()ing
and before exec()ing in a multi-threaded program should be
async-signal-safe.

Version 2.2.6b (6th June 2004)
--------------

	Carry out Filename to UTF-8 conversion in
	MainWindow:get_file_slot() (mainwindow.cpp).

	Further clean ups of use of Glib::ustring and std::string
	(dialogs.cpp).

	Some changes to the build system so that AC_CHECK_FILES is used
	instead of AC_CHECK_FILE, and the install will not fail if there
	is no user 'lp' on the system (acinclude.m4, configure.ac and
	prog_defs.h).

	Socket_server::is_files() method added (socket_server.h,
	socket_server.cpp and mainwindow.cpp)
	
Version 2.2.6a (6th May 2004)
--------------

Bulgarian translation (Zdravko Nikolov).

Italian translation updated (Luca De Rugeriis).

Some bug fixes (main.cpp, file_list.cpp socket_list.cpp).

Version 2.2.6 (12th April 2004)
-------------

The program will now compile and work with gtkmm-2.4, as well as
gtkmm-2.2 and gtkmm-2.0.

The settings dialog contains two new options.  First, the user can
elect to execute a program or have a pop-up dialog appear whenever a
fax is received.  If a program is executed, it will be passed the
number of the fax received as appearing in the faxes received list as
an argument.  Two executable scripts, mail_fax and print_fax, are
provided for the purpose.  (efax_controller.cpp, main.cpp,
mainwindow.cpp and settings.cpp).

Second, the user can elect not to bring up the confirmatory pop-up
dialog after pressing the "Print selected fax" button in the Received
Faxes list or Sent Faxes list.  (fax_list.cpp, main.cpp,
mainwindow.cpp and settings.cpp).

The efax-gtk.desktop file is now installed in $datadir/applications
instead of $datadir/gnome/apps/Applications, and it uses the icon
supplied with GNOME-2.6 comprising stock_send-fax.png.

The use of Glib::ustring and std::string is rationalised and cleaned
up (dialogs.cpp, fax_list.cpp and socket_list.cpp).

Version 2.2.5a (6th March 2004)
--------------

Polish translation (Pawel Suwinski).

A fax can now be sent on an open telephone connection if no telephone
number is entered into the "Tel Number" box (this does the same thing
as 'fax send -m ...' using the efax 'fax' script from the command
line).

'efax-gtk [filename]' now works correctly again.

For users of lpd/lprng, efax-gtk-socket-client now logs error messages
via syslog().

Version 2.2.5 (5th February 2004)
-------------

The dialog which notifies whether a fax has been received for sending
from the socket can be used to send the fax.  The documentation
(README and helpfile.cpp) has been updated to reflect this.

Faxes received via the socket server from the print system are now
stored in the user's home directory($HOME/efax-gtk-server), rather
than in the /tmp directory for security reasons.

The version number is correctly reported after enterering 'efax-gtk
--help' or 'efax-gtk --version'.

The order of entries in this ChangeLog/NEWS file has been reversed.

Version 2.2.4 (10th January 2004)
-------------

A potential race condition, which can manifest itself in Linux kernel
2.6 (but not kernel 2.4) can occur by
efax_controller_childexit_handler() being called in
efax_controller.cpp before fork() in EfaxController::sendfax() or
EfaxController::receive() has returned in the parent process, so
confusing the test of child_pid in fax_controller_childexit_handler().
This has been corrected by masking SIGCHLD immediately before the
fork(), and unmasking it after fork() returns. Also a theoretical race
condition in EfaxController::timer_event() has been corrected
(efax_controller.cpp, sig_mask.h).

Minor revision to efax-gtk.spec.in (Philip Tellis).

MAXMSGBUF is now defined in efax/efaxmsg.c so that it does not exceed
PIPE_BUF/2 in size.  This is so that a message from efax does not
overrun the pipe used to communicate with efax-gtk.

Version 2.2.3 (29th December 2003)
-------------

Choosing "Enter multiple files" in the File drop-down menu now brings
up the correct dialog (MainWindow::MainWindow() in mainwindow.cpp).

The socket server does not now run in its own thread (prog_defs.h,
main.cpp, socket_server.h and socket_server.cpp).  The need to make
fork() calls in order to invoke gs, gv, efax or efix to create, view
and print faxes (and to wait() on these child processes on occasions),
and the fact that fax viewing could cause a child process to exit at a
time not of the programs choosing (it will be at the time of the
user's choosing), makes it practically impossible to employ threading
and also write the program in a way which is reasonably clean and
complies with the requirement that any system calls between fork()ing
and exec()ing in a multi-threaded program should be designated as
async-signal-safe:

IEEE Std 1003.1, 2003 Edition:
	A process shall be created with a single thread. If a
	multi-threaded process calls fork(), the new process shall
	contain a replica of the calling thread and its entire address
	space, possibly including the states of mutexes and other
	resources. Consequently, to avoid errors, the child process may
	only execute async-signal-safe operations until such time as one
	of the exec functions is called.

Clean up of return values of Pipe_fifo::read() and Pipe_fifo::write()
(pipes.h and pipes.cpp) and related changes (efax_controller.cpp).

Revision of childexit_signalhandler(), and clean-up related code in
main.cpp (mainwindow.cpp and main.cpp).

Version 2.2.2 (1st November 2003)
-------------

The pop-up dialog which announces the receipt of a fax from the socket
server will display itself even if efax-gtk is minimised
(mainwindow.cpp - MainWindow::fax_received_notify_slot()).

The fax lists, socket list and help dialog will be raised if they are
selected and have already been created (mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cpp,
helpfile.h and helpfile.cpp).

Where a fax is queued for sending in the socket list, a small red
circle will appear in the main program window (mainwindow.h and
mainwindow.cpp).

When closing, the program will save its window size and whether fax
input is selected as File or Socket.

In Socket_server::is_valid_peer(), the parameter is passed by constant
reference rather than by value (socket_server.h and
socket_server.cpp).

Starting efax-gtk with --version or --help as parameters gives an
appropriate response (main.cpp).

Clean-up of code using std::stringstream (efax_controller.ccp -
EfaxController::make_fax(), EfaxController::save_sent_fax(),
EfaxController::cleanup_fax_send_fail(); fax_list.cpp -
FaxListDialog::fax_to_ps(); socket_list.cpp -
SocketListDialog::set_socket_list_rows()).

configure script now checks for libsigc++>= 1.2.3 (libsigc++1.2.2 and
less have a bug causing a segfault when a slot deletes the object of
which it is a member).

Version 2.2.1 (20th October 2003)
-------------

stringstream is used instead of strstream where available (and a test
for stringstream added to the configure script).

Changed user interface for choosing the file to be faxed
(mainwindow.h/mainwindow.cpp).

PS header in const char PSBEGIN [] in efax/efaxlib.c changed so that
multi-page postscript files produced by efix will print correctly in
CUPS 1.1.19 and above (EPS headers should only occur in single page
files).

Test for fully qualified localhost name included in
Socket_server::is_valid_peer().

A efax-gtk.desktop file is installed in
$datadir/gnome/apps/Applications

Italian translation updated.

Version 2.2.0 (8th September 2003)
-------------
-pre (31st August 2003); -pre2 (1st September 2003); -pre3 (5th September 2003)
-pre4 (6th September 2003); -pre5 (7th September 2003)

A socket server is provided enabling the print system (particularly
CUPS) to interface directly with efax-gtk.

Patch level a: (14th September 2003)
Fix a potential file descriptor leak in
Socket_server:::make_socket_thread() and set up a signal mask for that
thread to block SIGCHLD.

Patch level b: (21st September 2003)
UTF-8 conversion errors are now handled gracefully (that is, by
reporting the error and proceeding as appropriately as possible),
without terminating the program.  This has required enabling
exceptions.

Version 1.0.8 and 2.0.9 (25th August 2003)
------------------------------------------

A postscript printer driver file (Fax-fax-printer.ppd) is provided to
make it easier to print via CUPS, and installed by default in
/usr/share/cups/model.

In version 2.0.9, an issue with word wrapping in the main program text
window (which shows progress in fax negotiations) is corrected.

The build system has been rewritten so that it now uses automake.

Version 1.0.7 and 2.0.8
-----------------------

A "Manage/reorder multiple files" button to the right of the "File to
fax" entry brings up a dialog which enables the order of multiple
files to be changed and for further files to be added.

Version 1.0.6 and 2.0.7
-----------------------

The efax-gtk distribution now also compiles and installs a patched
version of efax-0.9a-001114, so you do not need to separately build
and install efax.  A number of users reported problems sending or
printing faxes when in locales which express their floating point
numbers with a comma as the decimal designator instead of the
full-stop (which applies to most of Europe outside the UK and
Ireland): efax and efix incorrectly use C formatted text functions
after calling setlocale().  The patch simply omits the call to
setlocale(), so the C locale is used in all cases.  To avoid name
conflicts the patched versions of efax and efix are installed as
efax-0.9a and efix-0.9a.  If you want to use the standard
distributions of efax, delete efax-0.9a and efix-0.9a, and then make a
symbolic link from efax to efax-0.9a and from efix to efix-0.9a so
that efax-gtk can find them.

The program can now send multiple postscript files as a single
fax. The files are included in the fax in the order in which they
appear in the 'File to fax' box.

The efax-gtkrc configuration file is now by default installed in
$prefix/etc, rather than /etc (but the relevant directory can still be
changed by passing the --sysconfdir=[dir] option to ./configure).
Installed files can be uninstalled from the Makefile by entering 'make
uninstall'.

Version 2.0.6
-------------

Build system for translation (*.po) files provided.  Translation files
for it (by Luca De Rugeriis) and en_GB locales installed.

Version 2.0.5
-------------

Automatic button re-sizing implemented properly.  Internationalisation
support correctly initialised.

Patch level a: modal dialogs have appropriate window hints, and a
window icon is provided for all top level windows.

Version 2.0.4
-------------

Buttons with focus now show consistently with Gnome-2 style settings,
and the buttons in the main program window will correctly resize for
the application font size used.  The focus chain for main program
window has been corrected.

Version 1.0.5 and 2.0.3
-----------------------

A more friendly help dialog is provided.

Some minor improvements/fixes for version 2.0.*.

Version 2.0.2
-------------

Fix bug in build system (this does not affect version 1.0.4).

Versions 1.0.4 and 2.0.1
------------------------

Insufficient read permissions on a file to be sent are now correctly
reported.

Minor change to the build system.

The column headings in the fax received and fax sent dialogs are now
corrected in efax-gtk-2.0.

Versions 1.0.3 and 2.0.0
------------------------

After sending a fax, the program cleans up after itself by deleting
old tiffg3 files ([filesent].001, [filesent].002, etc.).

There is a bug in efix in the efax-0.9a distribution which causes
errors when used in certain locales (this appears to be connected with
floating point representations).  A work-around has been included to
get round this (all page sizes and related dimensions are now given in
whole numbers of millimetres).

efax-2.0.0 is a port to Gtk+-2.*/Gtkmm-2.*.  It is functionally
identical to efax-1.0.3, but has internationalisation support.

Version 1.0.2
-------------

Autconf 2.5 has been used to create the configure script.

The settings dialog has been improved.

There is a new "View" button in the dialog brought up from the "File
to fax:" dialog, which enables files to be checked before they are
sent.

Faxes in the Sent fax list and the Received fax list are now viewed
using a postcript viewer, such as gv, ggv or kghostscript.

Patch level a: change to the efax-gtk-send script.

Version 1.0.1
-------------

A bug in the setting up of the logfile through the Settings dialog has
been corrected.

A bug in aclocal.m4, which would cause the incorrect binary directory
to be chosen if configure is run with the --prefix=[DIR] parameter,
has been corrected.

The Settings dialog now has a `Reset' button, which will reset all the
settings in it from the global configuration file (/etc/efax-gtkrc or
/usr/local/etc/efax-gtkrc).

The source files now come with a RPM spec file, so that a RPM binary
can be created by entering `rpm -tb efax-gtk-[version].src.tgz'.

A man file is also now provided.

Patch level a: a missing header in settings.cpp has been added, so the
program now compiles with STLport.

Patch level b: the configure script now checks for gtkmm-1.2.5 or
higher (earlier versions, such as the one supplied with Redhat 7.2, do
not compile efax-gtk correctly).  A few minor bug fixes.

Version 1.0.0
-------------

Program settings may now be changed by using the Settings dialog,
which is brought up from the File/Settings pull-down menu.

Various bug fixes (in particular Standby mode now has better
modem/serial port error handling).

Version 0.93
------------

Progress on negotiations and fax status, and errors and warnings, can
be logged to a log file specified in the efax-gtkrc configuration
file, or by redirecting stdout and stderr.

A few code clean-ups.

Version 0.92
------------

There is now a sent fax list as well as a received fax list.

The lists are now automatically sorted in chronological order.

The received fax list will not show any empty directory when the
program is standing by, or in the middle of receiving a fax.

Some unnecessary efax messages are not displayed in the efax messages
box.

Patch level a: program will compile with Redhat 7.1/7.2

Version 0.91
------------

Addresses can be arranged (moved up and down) in the addressbook.

An error in the description of the operation of the CLASS: parameter
in efax-gtkrc has been corrected.

Version 0.90
------------

First publicly available release.
